But that's exactly what Amnesty International has done, in a heart-warming video called Human Rights Heroes Of The Future, which poses such questions to children ranging in age from five to nine. One girl is asked: What did Nelson Mandela do? She says: 'He stood up for what he believed - that white people shouldn't just have all the fun and black people should have fun as well.' Another is asked: Who was Nelson Mandela? She replies: 'Nelson Mandela was a man who thought that black people should just have the amount of right just as the white people should. 'But then he was put into jail because of what he said - and then he finally went out because people were protesting for him to come out. And then there was a song Free Nelson Mandela - and everything kind of became how he wanted it to be.' Meanwhile, an equally challenging poser is put to a 'short five-year-old' boy: What does equality look like? His sweet response? 'If there was one man over here like he was five years old, and one man over here like he was five years old too, they would all be the same size.' 'Nelson Mandela was a man who thought that black people should just have the amount of right just as the white people should.' This was the reply to one of a series of human rights questions put by Amnesty International to children aged five to nine . 'Fear - the more you worry about it, the bigger it gets... and the more you think positively, the more fear would be, like friendly - you wouldn't worry about anything, and have a great time basically' 'If there was one man over here like he was five years old, and one man over here like he was five years old too, they would all be the same size' Other questions put to the youngsters included topics that might faze some grown-ups. For example: At a time of daunting global events, many people are afraid. What would you advise? A boy, aged about nine's reply? 'Fear - the more you worry about it, the bigger it gets... and the more you think positively, the more fear would be, like friendly - you wouldn't worry about anything, and have a great time basically.' The video was released by the human rights organisation to coincide with the publication of its new book Dreams Of Freedom on World Book Day. The book combines the words of human rights heroes such as Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Anne Frank, Chief Standing Bear, Malala and Aung San Suu Kyi with beautiful illustrations from international artists including Oliver Jeffers and Chris Riddell. In a time when children across the world are traumatised, frightened and confused by news events, the aim of the book is to empower them to explore hard-won rights and understand how precious they are. 'The world wouldn't be the same... the world would be terrible - and it would be quite boring' 'Being unique without anybody stopping you being unique' The video was released by the human rights organisation to coincide with the publication of its new book Dreams Of Freedom on World Book Day . Author and former Children’s Laureate Michael Morpurgo wrote in the foreword to the book: 'Dreams Of Freedom is a feast of visual stories – brave words and beautiful pictures, woven together to inspire young readers to stand up for others and to make a difference. 'It gives me great hope for the freedom of future generations. 'I have grown up, not in a perfect country by any means, but in a society where, by and large, we can say what we like, write what we like, be who we want to be, so long as we do not threaten the liberty of others and so long as we respect their rights. 'What we can forget, if we are not careful, is that it was not always like this. These rights have been fought for, died for, argued over, for centuries. 'Indeed the struggle to protect and defend our freedom goes on, both in our own country and in the world beyond.' Kate Allen, Amnesty’s UK Director, said: 'In a time when many children can't help seeing news about threats from terrorism and other atrocities, this book celebrates heroism and shows how important it is for all of us to stand up and make a difference. 'Every child should be given the strength to stand up for themselves and each other. 'There is no better book to inspire and empower young readers, to give them courage and confidence for the future.'

West is known for rankling people on stage.  Now it\\'s his turn to get a virtual smackdown. One music fan in the UK wants him out of the Glastonbury Festival so bad, he\\'s started a petition to make it happen. In his petition, Neil Lonsdale describes the rapper as an \"egotistical, maniacal, disgrace.\" He calls on organizers to replace the  \"Yeezus\" singer  at the Glastonbury Festival this summer. West is booked to headline the festival, which runs between June 24-28. His performance is Saturday. \"Kanye West is an insult to music fans all over the world,\"  Lonsdale says in the change.org petition.  \"We spend hundreds of pounds to attend glasto, and by doing so, expect a certain level of entertainment.\" The petition urges West to  \"pass his headline slot on to someone deserving.\" Lonsdale is not the only music fan upset by his scheduled performance.

The UEFA president, who was on the pitch for Juventus at the European Cup final in Brussels 30 years ago when 39 people - mainly from the Italian club - died after rioting Liverpool fans charged Juve supporters causing a wall to collapse. Platini has called for tougher stadium bans and a European-wide sports police force. Speaking at the UEFA Congress in Vienna, Platini said: 'Europe is seeing a rise in nationalism and extremism the like of which we have not witnessed for a very long time. Michel Platini wants to see a European sports police force introduced to prevent football hooliganism . 'This insidious trend can also be observed in our stadiums, as football is a reflection of society. Given its popularity, our sport is a barometer for the ills of our continent. And that barometer is pointing to some worrying developments. 'I therefore renew my call for greater awareness of this issue among the public authorities, so that we can avoid reliving the dark days of a not-so-distant past - a past where hooligans and all manner of fanatics called the shots in certain European stadiums. 'In recent months, we have all been struck by certain images that I thought were a thing of the past. Some of us experienced that past at first hand. In my case, it was exactly 30 years ago ... Nobody wants a repeat of such events. The Heysel disaster took place in 1985 during European Cup Final between Juventus and Liverpool . 39 fans were killed when they were crushed to death when Liverpool fans breached the neutral area . Most of the fatalities were Juventus fans and Platini wants to avoid any future incidents like this . 'We need tougher stadium bans at European level and - I will say it again - the creation of a European sports police force.' Platini also appeared to have a veiled dig at Sepp Blatter for deciding to run for a fifth term as FIFA president despite having said at the UEFA Congress four years ago that his fourth term would be his last. Blatter then described himself as the 'captain of the ship in troubled waters bringing in back on the right route'. The Italian, who is himself being re-elected unopposed for a third term, told UEFA delegates: 'I regard myself as a simple team-mate - at most your captain. But not the captain of a ship that is being battered by a storm.' Dynamo Kiev fans clash with riot police during mass fighting in the Olympiyski Stadium in the Europa League . Kiev's players were forced to step in and try to calm their fans down which forced the match to be halted . Sept Blatter is preparing to run for a fifth term despite saying that his current one would be his last . Platini's printed speech included the words 'clinging to the helm for dear life' but he dropped that line when he delivered the speech, saying only: 'No. I am simply the captain of a winning team - one that wins because it boasts 54 talented presidents and general secretaries who are prepared to play for each other.' In his speech to the Congress on Tuesday, Blatter made no reference to standing again for FIFA president but once again urged football to resist calls to boycott to the 2018 World Cup in Russia due to its involvement in the civil war in Ukraine. Blatter said: 'Football shall be united, sport shall be united when it comes to boycotts because boycott has never given any results. We have to pay attention to political interference's. The autonomy of sport must be guaranteed.' Platini has experienced first hand football hooliganism when he was on the pitch for the Heysel disaster .\""},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import pipeline\n\nsummarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\", model=\"fine_tuned_t5_small_cnn_dailymail_model\")\npred = summarizer(text)\npred","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-23T20:35:19.866319Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-23T20:35:19.867149Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-23T20:35:24.538113Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-23T20:35:19.867114Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-23T20:35:24.537180Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (908 > 512).
